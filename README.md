# BSACounter

Counts the number of BSA/BA2 files in selected folder and its sub folders.

**How to Use:**

To use set the following arguments (in MO2 or the shortcut you use to launch it):
```cmd
"path/to/mods/" "path/to/modlist.txt"
```
`modlist.txt` is optional but without it it doesn't filter deactivated mods.
